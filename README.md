Web-Based Data Visualization Using R, Python, Shiny and Python Flask

# Shiny R

When I tried to run my shiny app in posit cloud using the code, my console stated that it could not find the function "arthritis_data". This was because in line 42 under "render the bar plot", my code was ``` arthritis_data <- arthritis_data``` instead of ```arthritis_data <- df()```. After I edited my code, I was able to run my code smoothly and deploy on shiny.



# Shiny Python

# Python Flask
I had no issues running my flask application in the google shell environment terminal locally.
